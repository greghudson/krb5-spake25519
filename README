This repository contains some curve25519 SPAKE code, adapted to stand
alone from BoringSSL and use an interface closer to what MIT krb5
would need, with a test main() function to allow timing tests.  There
is also a test program to perform equivalent operations using
OpenSSL's implementation of P-256, for speed comparison.
